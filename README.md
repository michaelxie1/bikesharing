Overview:
The purpose of this project was to gain an overview of Tableau and learn how to display information utilizing the CitiBike information from August 2019. The module went back to Pandas, where I was able to change the datatype of a certain column (trip duration). From there, I was able to create visualizations for information that correlated thigs such as gender and time. 
Results:
 
Within this image, it displays how long bikes were checked out for all riders.

This visualization displays how long bikes were checked out as well, but also by each gender.

The following heatmap displays the same information as the previous image, only it takes into account gender as well.

The following data shows the number of bikes in need of repairs, by the highest number of rentals.

Summary:
Through this, we were able to visualize bike rentals and correlate the information to aspects such as gender and time. In addition to these graphs, some additional visualizations that could be created would be correlating the start-time and end-time to both the start-station and end-stations. This could allow for us to see which station is the most popular and at what times. We could also correlate gender and geographic location (latitude/longitude) and see if there can be a pattern that is distinguishable between the two factors.
